// Package setting defines shared Dox runtime identity setting fragments.

// The package intentionally contains reusable identity fragments such as
// Application and Deployment. It is not a global runtime Setting aggregate.
// Each Dox runtime owns its concrete setting aggregate and may compose these
// fragments when their semantics match that runtime.
